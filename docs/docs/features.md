# Features

Aoi Tori is the successor to Twitter Stream, a WordPress plugin I authored quite a long time ago. It is designed to add features I wanted to add back then, but didn't have the knowledge to implement.

## Main Features

- Simpler oAuth Authentication with Twitter
- Custom built options page
- Widget or PHP function (shortcode coming soon)
- A small selection of built in display templates
- Roll your own template with ease
- Customize colors easily (on built in templates)
- Customize margins/paddings easily (on built in templates)

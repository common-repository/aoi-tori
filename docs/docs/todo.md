# ToDo

This is a list of planned features or items that have yet to be implemented. There is no particular order, but in general I work on simpler ones first to get that out of the way, unless another feature is urgently required.

* Add the ability to load a custom template from the currently active theme directory as a third alternative to the built-in templates and custom template box.

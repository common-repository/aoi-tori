## The Name?

You may have noticed that this plugin has an odd name. It was originally going to continue to call it Twitter Stream. However the plugin is now so far from the original version in features, and I was worried about continuing to use Twitter in its name. So I decided to rename it.

Aoi Tori (Kanji: 青い鳥 / Katakana: あおいとり) is Japanese for Blue Bird. I am currently learning Japanese and thought it was an interesting name for the plugin. Plus it is still related to Twitter since we all recognise the famous blue bird that Twitter use for their branding.

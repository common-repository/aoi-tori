# Installation

Installation is pretty simple, just search on the WordPress plugin directory from your WordPress admin dashboard for 'Aoi Tori' and click install. Activate and you are ready to go. In case you want to go the old fashioned way, here are manual install instructions. If you prefer Git, then that's here too.

## Manual Install

1. Download the plugin from the WordPress plugin directory, or via the GitHub repo.
2. Connect to your server using SFTP.
3. Navigate to your WordPress plugins directory. If the zip you downloaded has a folder inside, upload the folder to the plugins directory. If it does not, create a folder called 'aoi-tori' and upload the contents of the zip into that folder.
4. Login to the WordPress admin, go to plugins, and activate.

## Git Install

1. Connect to your server via SSH.
2. Navigate to the plugins directory.
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/nabesaka/aoi-tori aoi-tori`
4. Login to the WordPress admin, go to plugins, activate.

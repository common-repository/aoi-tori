This is the documentation for the WordPress plugin Aoi Tori created & maintained by Paul Robinson.

## What is Aoi Tori?

Aoi Tori is a simple WordPress plugin that allows you to show your Tweet's on your WordPress blog with very little fuss or effort.

While there are instructions on how to install and use the plugin on the WordPress plugin directory, and on the install splash screen, this documentation is designed to help though having trouble with the plugin or who want to delve into the more advanced features available.

## Requirements

Due to some of the code used in Aoi Tori there are a few pre-requisites. There shouldn't be anything out of the ordinary that any good host would not already have available, but please do check first if you are unsure.

- **PHP 5.3.10** or greater (PHP 5.5 is highly recommended)
- **cURL PHP** Extension
- **cURL** must be able to make **HTTPS** calls

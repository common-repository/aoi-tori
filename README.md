# Aoi Tori - A Twitter Plugin for WordPress

Aoi Tori is a Twitter Plugin for WordPress. You can install it directly via your WordPress dashboard by going to your plugins area and searching for Aoi Tori. It is hosted here for proper version control and pushed to SVN so it can appear on the WordPress plugin directory.

## Information

For more information please check out [Aoi Tori's documentation](https://nabesaka.github.io/aoi-tori).

## Twitter Stream Deprecation

I will be deprecating Twitter Stream very soon so it is advised to use this plugin from this point on. If you need any help please check out the documentation, or check out the support section of those docs if you need further help with anything.

## Bugs

Please notify my of any bugs as soon as you can. Please email me or use the issue tracker here on Github, do not report them via WordPress as I may not see them since I use Github as my primary version control.

If you find a security issue please follow responsible disclosure. Send me an email directly as soon as you can and I will find a solution as soon as possible. Do not report security issues using Github's issue tracker for all to see.


## Notes

Keen eyes may have spotted the `vendor` folder has been uploaded. This was done purposefully. Since this Github repo will be a direct mirror for the SVN repo it must contain all of the files required for it to work for the general end-user. Since running `composer install` would be awkward for most and impossible on some shared hosting, it is included so that isn't required.
